# Documentation
The documentation is generated by Swagger. Currently, the documentation is available in JSON and YAML formats. 
I am still trying to display the documentation in the Swagger UI.
1. JSON format address:
```
    http://localhost:8081/swagger.json
```
2. YAML format address:
```
    http://localhost:8081/swagger.yaml
```
